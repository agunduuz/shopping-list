<img src="images/shopping-list.png" width="300">
This project was developed using Vanilla JS. It incorporates CRUD operations, DOM manipulation, event handling, and Local Storage. Additionally, filtering options are also implemented. In the UI, I used vibrant colors that were inspired by the excitement of acquiring new items. 🎨💫
